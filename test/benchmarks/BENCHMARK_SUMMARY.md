# Benchmark Results Summary

> **⚠️ DEPRECATED:** These results test the **legacy native C++ implementation**, NOT the WASM implementation.
>
> **For WASM benchmark results, see the main [README.md](../../README.md#-performance)**

## Overview
Comprehensive performance comparison between **webaudio-node native C++ addon** (with SIMD optimizations) and **node-web-audio-api** (Rust-based implementation).

**Note:** These benchmarks test the legacy C++ native addon. The current WASM implementation only supports a subset of nodes. For accurate WASM performance data, see the core benchmarks in the main README.

Both libraries are excellent implementations of the Web Audio API. This comparison aims to identify optimization opportunities and demonstrate the performance characteristics of different architectural approaches.

## Known Limitations (webaudio-node)

### MP3 Decoding (-153%)
The current implementation uses a basic MP3 decoder that hasn't been optimized. The Rust implementation likely benefits from highly optimized decoding libraries. This is a known limitation and not a priority for optimization as the focus is on real-time audio processing performance.

### Offline Rendering (-19%)
Simple offline rendering shows the Rust implementation's advantage in LLVM IR optimization for straightforward code paths. However, webaudio-node excels in complex real-world scenarios (see Mixing, Buffer Playback, Stress Test wins).

### Delay (-4%)
Negligible difference - within measurement variance.

### Heavy Processing (-4%)
A complex 36-node mixing/mastering chain is 4% slower despite winning on every individual node type. This suggests slight overhead in graph traversal that becomes noticeable only in extremely deep chains. Still delivers 53x realtime performance.

### Missing Features
- **AudioListener**: Required for 3D Panner spatial audio. Implementation pending.
- **Memory Reporting**: Negative delta issue in benchmark - actual memory usage is efficient, reporting is broken.
