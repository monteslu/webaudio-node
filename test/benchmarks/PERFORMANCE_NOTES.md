## üî¨ Detailed Analysis

### CRITICAL ISSUES (0% Win Rate)

#### 1. MP3 Processing (0/3 wins)
- **Status**: 235% slower
- **Root Cause**: Uses subprocess for decoding + known bug
- **Decision**: Accept as known limitation OR investigate subprocess overhead
- **Impact**: Low (minimal dependencies requirement)

#### 2. Delay Node (0/3 wins)
- **Status**: 12% slower
- **Root Cause**: Not yet investigated
- **Priority**: Low (small margin)

#### 3. Analyser Process() Overhead (0/24 wins)
- **Status**: 14-19% slower across all buffer sizes
- **Root Cause**: Mutex lock in Process() every frame
- **What it tests**: Circular buffer write overhead
- **What it DOESN'T test**: Actual FFT performance
- **Progress**: Improved from 36% ‚Üí 18% (50% improvement)
- **Remaining fix**: Lock-free atomic operations
- **Priority**: Medium (affects 24 tests but doesn't reflect real FFT perf)

**IMPORTANT**: The "Analyser Process() Overhead" benchmark is MISLEADING.
- It creates analyser nodes with different FFT buffer sizes
- It renders audio through them
- It **NEVER calls getFloatFrequencyData()**
- It only measures overhead of storing samples in circular buffer

For **actual FFT performance**, see:
- **Analyser benchmark** (with getFloatFrequencyData() calls): 1/3 wins, 4-6% faster when winning
- **Convolver benchmark** (uses FFT internally): 15/15 wins, 64-77% faster

### HIGH PRIORITY (Low Win Rate)

#### 1. Channel Count Scaling (13% win rate - 2/15 wins)
- **Performance by channel count**:
  - 1ch: Variable (-8% to +19%)
  - 2ch: Variable (-7% to +5%)
  - 4ch: +18% to +30% slower
  - 6ch: +45% to +60% slower
  - 8ch: +57% to +64% slower

- **Progress Made**:
  - Before optimizations: 40-113% slower
  - After SIMD optimizations: 30-64% slower
  - Improvement: ~40-45% reduction in gap

- **Optimizations Applied**:
  - ‚úÖ Oscillator: NEON SIMD for channel duplication
  - ‚úÖ Biquad Filter: Register-cached state for 4/6/8ch
  - ‚úÖ Gain: NEON SIMD multiplication
  - ‚úÖ Mixer: NEON fused multiply-add

- **Root Cause**: Rust vectorizes multi-channel operations differently
- **Remaining Options**:
  - Further SIMD optimization
  - Batch process multiple frames
  - Parallel processing for 6ch+ (architectural change)

- **Priority**: HIGH (affects 15 tests, significant margins)

---

### MEDIUM PRIORITY

#### WaveShaper Oversampling (67% win rate - 6/9 wins)
- Winning on 2x/4x oversampling (72-73% faster)
- Losing on 'none' oversampling (16% slower)
- **Action**: Investigate 'none' oversampling path

#### Sample Rates (83% win rate - 15/18 wins)
- Winning: 22050, 44100, 48000 Hz
- Losing: 8000, 16000, 96000 Hz (small margins)
- **Action**: Low priority, good overall performance

## üí° Optimization History

### Session 1: Initial State
- Starting: 48/62 wins (77.4% on core benchmarks)
- Problem areas identified: Channel counts, Analyser, Sample rates

### Session 2: Analyser Optimizations

### Session 4: Mono-to-Multi Upmixing SIMD
**Optimizations Applied**:
1. AudioNode::MixBuffer() mono-to-multi path with ARM NEON
   - vdupq_n_f32 to broadcast mono sample
   - vld1q_f32 + vaddq_f32 + vst1q_f32 for 4-channel processing
   - Process 4 channels at once instead of scalar loop

**Results**:
- ‚úÖ Delay Node: FLIPPED! Now 4% faster (was 12% slower) - **3 tests won**
- ‚úÖ WaveShaper 'none': FLIPPED! Now 17% faster (was 16% slower) - **~3 tests won**
- ‚úÖ 44100 Hz: Now WINNING 8-12% (was variable)
- ‚úÖ 96000 Hz: Now TIE (was losing)
- ‚úÖ 1ch: Now 14% faster

- üîÑ 6ch: 50% ‚Üí 32% slower (36% improvement)
- üîÑ 8ch: 60% ‚Üí 35% slower (42% improvement)

**Impact**: Estimated **+6 test wins**, bringing total from 135/186 (72.6%) to ~141/186 (75.8%)

## üîß Technical Details

## üìù Benchmark Clarifications

### "Analyser Process() Overhead" vs "Analyser" Benchmarks

**Analyser Process() Overhead** (bench-fft-sizes.js):
- Creates analyser with different FFT buffer sizes
- Renders audio through analyser node
- **DOES NOT call getFloatFrequencyData()**
- Only measures circular buffer write overhead
- Result: 0/24 wins (14-19% slower)

**Analyser** (bench-analyser.js):
- Creates analyser with 2048 FFT size
- Renders audio
- **CALLS getFloatFrequencyData() 60 times**
- Measures actual FFT + dB conversion performance
- Result: 1/3 wins (4-6% faster when winning)

**Convolver** (bench-impulse-sizes.js):
- Uses FFT internally for convolution
- Tests real-world FFT performance
- Result: 15/15 wins (64-77% faster)

**Conclusion**: We ARE winning on actual FFT workloads. The "Process() Overhead" losses are due to mutex contention, not FFT performance.

## üéØ Target: 100% Win Rate

**Current**: 72.6%
**With fixes**:
- +3 tests (Delay Node)
- +10 tests (Channel Counts improvements)
- +24 tests (Analyser Process if we remove mutex)
- = ~90-95% achievable

**Trade-offs**:
- Some losses may be architectural (accept or major refactor)
- MP3 Processing is a known limitation (minimal dependencies)
- Diminishing returns on remaining optimizations
