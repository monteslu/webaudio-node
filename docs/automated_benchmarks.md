## Interpretation

- **Render Time (ms):** Time taken to render 1 second of audio. Lower is better.
- **Realtime Multiplier:** How many times faster than realtime the rendering is. Higher is better.
  - Example: 100x means it can render 100 seconds of audio in 1 second
- **游릭 WASM:** webaudio-node is faster for this benchmark
- **游댮 Rust:** node-web-audio-api is faster for this benchmark
- **游리 Similar:** Performance difference is within 1% (essentially equivalent)

## Notes

These benchmarks measure offline rendering performance, which is different from realtime audio playback. Results may vary based on:
- Hardware (CPU, memory)
- Operating system
- Node.js version
- System load during testing

Both implementations are capable of realtime audio processing as indicated by realtime multipliers significantly greater than 1.0x.
