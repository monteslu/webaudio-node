## Interpretation

- **Render Time (ms):** Time taken to render 1 second of audio. Lower is better.
- **Realtime Multiplier:** How many times faster than realtime the rendering is. Higher is better.
  - Example: 100x means it can render 100 seconds of audio in 1 second
- **游릭 WASM:** webaudio-node is faster for this benchmark
- **游댮 Rust:** node-web-audio-api is faster for this benchmark
- **游리 Similar:** Performance difference is within 1% (essentially equivalent)

## Notes

These benchmarks measure offline rendering performance, which is different from realtime audio playback. Results may vary based on:
- Hardware (CPU, memory)
- Operating system
- Node.js version
- System load during testing

Both implementations are capable of realtime audio processing as indicated by realtime multipliers significantly greater than 1.0x.

### Additional Quality Considerations

**Audio Resampling Quality:**
- **webaudio-node** uses Speex resampler quality level 3 (same as Firefox) - production-quality resampling with SIMD optimizations
- **node-web-audio-api** uses basic linear interpolation - much lower quality but faster
- These benchmarks do NOT include resampling operations, so performance may differ when sample rate conversion is required
- For resampling-heavy workloads, webaudio-node prioritizes audio quality over raw speed

**Node Coverage:**
- **webaudio-node** implements 16/17 applicable Web Audio API nodes (94% coverage)
- **node-web-audio-api** node coverage may vary
