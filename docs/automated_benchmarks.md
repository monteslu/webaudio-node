## Overview

Comparative performance benchmarks between **webaudio-node native C++ addon** and **node-web-audio-api** (pure Rust implementation).

**Note:** These benchmarks test the legacy C++ implementation with native addons. The current WASM implementation only supports a subset of nodes (Oscillator, Gain, BufferSource). For accurate WASM performance data, see the core benchmarks in the main README.

### Summary Statistics

- **Total Benchmarks:** 31
- **webaudio-node (native C++) Wins:** 29 (93.5%)
- **node-web-audio-api Wins:** 2 (6.5%)
- **Similar Performance (within 1%):** 0 (0.0%)
- **Average Speedup (when faster):** 2331.9%

## Interpretation

- **Render Time (ms):** Time taken to render 1 second of audio. Lower is better.
- **Realtime Multiplier:** How many times faster than realtime the rendering is. Higher is better.
  - Example: 100x means it can render 100 seconds of audio in 1 second
- **游릭 WASM:** webaudio-node is faster for this benchmark
- **游댮 Rust:** node-web-audio-api is faster for this benchmark
- **游리 Similar:** Performance difference is within 1% (essentially equivalent)

## Notes

These benchmarks measure offline rendering performance, which is different from realtime audio playback. Results may vary based on:
- Hardware (CPU, memory)
- Operating system
- Node.js version
- System load during testing

Both implementations are capable of realtime audio processing as indicated by realtime multipliers significantly greater than 1.0x.
